# html2
A potential solution of the html-layouts-2 project

These are potential solutions to the first and third projects. I didn't complete the second today. Recognize that this is only one possible solution, not necessarily the best solution. This is especially true for the third project. I wanted to see if I could make the text wrap using flex. I mostly succeeded. If I were to actually produce a web page in the third project, I would probably just use actual columns instead of flex.
